I am a PhD student at the Institute for Computational Perception at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria and researcher in the project Human-Centered AI under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Markus Schedl. My main research interests are on Debiasing and Fairness for Recommender Systems. Previously, I had applied Reinforcement Learning algorithms to introduce personalization into Session-based Recommender Systems. Also, I hold meaningful work experience in Data Science and Software Development.
